All keys are required.

## Use Publish Tag

The example demonstrates how to add a job to your existing workflow to upload Infrastructure agents assets to your S3 bucket.

GitHub secrets to be set:

     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Specifies the secret key associated with the access key.
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY - Personal AWS access key.
     AWS_S3_BUCKET - Name of the AWS S3 bucket.

### Example Usage

    name: Publish

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - s3_publish_packages

    env:
      DOCKER_HUB_ID: ${{ secrets.OHAI_DOCKER_HUB_ID }}
      DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.OHAI_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}

    jobs:

      publish:
        name: Publish artifacts to s3
        runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Login to DockerHub
            uses: docker/login-action@v1
            with:
              username: ${{ env.DOCKER_HUB_ID }}
              password: ${{ env.DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}
          - name: Publish to S3 action
            uses: ./actions/publish
            with:
              aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
              aws_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
              aws_s3_bucket_name: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
              tag: "v1.0.0"
              app_name: "my-app"
              repo_name: "my-org/my-app"
              schema: "ohi"


## Consistency

As GitHub Actions can run many workflows in parallel, once a publish-action is called it execute a lock mechanism in S3 to avoid conflicts.

## Use Publish Tag

The example demonstrates how to add a job to your existing workflow to upload Infrastructure agents assets to your S3 bucket.

GitHub secrets to be set:

     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Specifies the secret key associated with the access key.
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Personal AWS access key.
     AWS_S3_BUCKET - Name of the AWS S3 bucket.

### Example Usage

```yaml
name: Publish

on:
  release:
    types:
      - released
    tags:
      - '*'

env:
  GPG_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.OHAI_GPG_PASSPHRASE }}
  GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64: ${{ secrets.OHAI_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64 }}
  TAG: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
  DOCKER_HUB_ID: ${{ secrets.OHAI_DOCKER_HUB_ID }}
  DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.OHAI_DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD }}
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: "nr-downloads-main"
  AWS_S3_LOCK_BUCKET_NAME: "onhost-ci-lock"

          gpg_private_key_base64: ${{ env.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64 }}
```

## Consistency

As GitHub Actions can run many workflows in parallel, once a publish-action is called it execute a lock mechanism in S3 to avoid conflicts. 
In the current implementation only one publish action with the same lock will be executed, all other concurrent jobs will be terminated by the lock file check.
